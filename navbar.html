<p>The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel</p>
<p>Hello darkness, my old friend</p>
<p>I've come to talk with you again</p>
<p>Because a vision softly creeping</p>
<p>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</p>
<p>And the vision that was planted in my brain</p>
<p>Still remains</p>
<p>Within the sound of silence</p>
<p>In restless dreams I walked alone</p>
<p>Narrow streets of cobblestone</p>
<p>'Neath the halo of a street lamp</p>
<p>I turned my collar to the cold and damp</p>
<p>When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light</p>
<p>That split the night</p>
<p>And touched the sound of silence</p>
<p>And in the naked light I saw</p>
<p>Ten thousand people, maybe more</p>
<p>People talking without speaking</p>
<p>People hearing without listening</p>
<p>People writing songs that voices never share</p>
<p>And no one dare</p>
<p>Disturb the sound of silence</p>
<p>"Fools" said I, "You do not know</p>
<p>Silence like a cancer grows</p>
<p>Hear my words that I might teach you</p>
<p>Take my arms that I might reach you"</p>
<p>But my words like silent raindrops fell</p>
<p>And echoed</p>
<p>In the wells of silence</p>
<p>And the people bowed and prayed</p>
<p>To the neon god they made</p>
<p>And the sign flashed out its warning</p>
<p>In the words that it was forming</p>
<p>And the sign said, "The words of the prophets</p>
<p>Are written on the subway walls</p>
<p>And tenement halls"</p>
<p>And whisper'd in the sounds of silence</p>
